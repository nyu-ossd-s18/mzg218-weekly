## Humanitarian Free and Open Source Software

None of the open source projects I know well are explicitly humanitarian.  However, many of the projects have an implicitly humanitarian 
aspect to them.  Projects like Linux, for example, broaden the base of free software that humanitarians have access to.  It empowers them
to do more, and to help more people.  It's a cliche, but free software truly does make the world better.

## Project status
We've basically decided to take ownership of Phaser's examples repo.  They're woefully out of date.  Some of us are looking to fix what 
exists already, while others (including me) are looking to add more examples to demonstrate a full game making use of Phaser.
