## Team Progress
Well at this point we're done :)  I'd say we did quite well.  We made lots of fixes to the examples repository, and Matt made a nice game
that exemplifies good parts of the API.

My contributions focused on assisting with bug triage and fixing examples.  I also left a comment encouraging someone to keep working on
their game, but I don't know if they saw it which makes me sad.  I feel like I successfully added to the project's usability.

## License
Phaser is distributed under an MIT license.  This basically allows users to do anything they want with the code, so long as the MIT license 
notice remains attached to it.  This is the perfect license for Phaser, as it allows the engine to be used and modified for user-made games,
both commercial and not.

## Contributions
Updated!
