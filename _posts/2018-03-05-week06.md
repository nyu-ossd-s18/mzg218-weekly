## Strengths and Weaknesses of the Phaser Team
As a team, I'd say we're quite good at communicating--I've barely met my teammates in person, yet I feel like we're able to work well 
together.  Our technical skills are all concentrated around JS, so that's good.  

Our greatest weakness will be our unfamiliarity with Phaser itself.  It seems easy enough to learn, but we haven't tried yet, so it could
still go wrong.

## Meeting Time
Primary: 2PM Sundays

Secondary: 6PM Wednesdays

## Milestones

* Learn about Phaser, maybe by making a game together.
* Develop fluency with its core features so that we can understand issues we see.
* Begin looking at issues we can fix.
* Fix them! (!)

## Open Data Week Events

* Data Through Design @ Made in NY DUMBO
* HUMAN DATA: The Impact of Open Data for Connected Infrastructure
