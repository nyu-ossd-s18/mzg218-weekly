## Editing Wikipedia
I edited [this article on a Russian electric car model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LADA_Ellada).  

When you make a new Wikipedia account, they give you a handy button to pull up a random page that can be improved with minor edits--I found this article by pressing that button about 100 times until I found an article I liked.

I made some grammar and syntax fixes on the first few sections of the article.  I also removed some information that was not cited, as well as a section of bare info that doesn't fit Wikipedia's style.
