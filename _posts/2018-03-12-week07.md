I was only able to make it out to one Open Data Week event, the art installation at the Made in NY Center in DUMBO.  
It was a collection of installments that featured open data prominently.  

There were a few interesting ones.  The most popular one was
a Markov chain trained on NYC government job listings, which would generate a new position on request in haiku form.  Below you see me in
 front of a map of NYC traffic fatalities.  It looked cool, but wasn't a very effective piece, as it was quite hard to read and didn't
have much of a statement to make.  Another notable one was a large clock that illustrated sexual assault reports using lights.

I was disappointed in the number of seemingly broken pieces at the exhibition.  There were two in the center of the room that I couldn't 
make sense of because they weren't operational.  Must be a shame for the artists.  It was also a very small exhibition, entirely taking 
place in the lobby of the building.
